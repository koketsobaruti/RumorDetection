this is a version of my rumor detection project that i have been working on that also contains Baysian optimization in order to improve model performance.
the feature engineering file contains the processes containing reading from the pheme rumor detection json dataset and generating new features namely sentiment using VADER and computing time_Delay feature.
the data analysis contains analysis on the PHEME dataset, individual features and a covariance matrix of all features. Emotion analysis features are also included at this stage. This file also contains PCA analysis to determine feature relevance.
